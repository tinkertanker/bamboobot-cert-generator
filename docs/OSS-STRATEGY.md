# Open Source Strategy

## Executive Summary

Release the current certificate generator as open source (AGPL v3) while maintaining a separate SaaS offering. This strategy follows the successful "open core" model used by Plausible Analytics and Cal.com - giving away a fully functional product while monetizing convenience and enterprise features.

**Core Principle**: Make self-hosting so easy that choosing SaaS is about convenience, not necessity.

## 🎯 Strategy Overview

### License Choice: AGPL v3

**Why AGPL?**
- Prevents SaaS competitors from using your code without contributing back
- Still allows internal/self-hosted commercial use
- Proven successful for similar projects (Plausible, Cal.com)
- Encourages community contributions

**What it means:**
- ✅ Companies can self-host for internal use
- ✅ Developers can modify and deploy for themselves
- ❌ Competitors can't offer it as a service without open-sourcing changes
- ✅ You can offer a dual license for enterprises if needed

## 📁 Repository Structure

### Option 1: Two Separate Repos (Recommended)

```
github.com/yourusername/
├── certificate-generator/          # Public OSS repo
│   ├── components/                 # All UI components
│   ├── pages/                      # Next.js pages

│
├── certificate-generator-cloud/    # Private SaaS repo
│   ├── extends: ../certificate-generator  # Git submodule or package
│   ├── packages/
│   │   ├── auth/                   # Supabase auth
│   │   ├── billing/                # Stripe integration
│   │   ├── analytics/              # PostHog, monitoring
│   │   └── limits/                 # Usage tracking
│   └── deployment/                 # Vercel/production configs
```

### Option 2: Monorepo with Feature Flags

```
certificate-generator/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                        # Main application
│   └── docs/                       # Documentation site
├── packages/
│   ├── core/                       # OSS features
│   ├── cloud/                      # SaaS features (optional deps)
│   └── ui/                         # Shared components
├── docker/                         # Self-hosting
└── package.json                    # Monorepo config
```

**Feature flags in code:**
```typescript
// utils/features.ts
export const features = {
  auth: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTH === 'true',
  billing: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_BILLING === 'true',
  analytics: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS === 'true',
  limits: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_LIMITS === 'true',
}

// Usage in components
{features.auth && <SignInButton />}
{features.limits && <UsageCounter />}
```

## 🎯 Quick Decision Framework

**Should this feature be OSS or SaaS-only?**

Ask yourself:
1. Is it core to certificate generation? → **OSS**
2. Does it require external services? → **SaaS** (but allow self-config)
3. Is it about team/enterprise use? → **SaaS**
4. Does it significantly increase hosting costs? → **SaaS**
5. Is it about convenience/automation? → **SaaS**

## Summary

The open source strategy centers on making self-hosting genuinely excellent while monetizing convenience and enterprise needs. By using AGPL licensing and maintaining clear feature differentiation, you can build both a thriving community and sustainable business. The key is respecting both audiences - self-hosters get a fully functional product, while SaaS customers get convenience and premium features.

**Remember**: Your open source users are your best marketing channel. Treat them well, and they'll become advocates for both the OSS project and your SaaS offering.
