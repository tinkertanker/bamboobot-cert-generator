# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is Bamboobot, a Next.js certificate generator application that allows users to upload image templates, convert them to PDFs, add draggable text fields, and generate bulk certificates from tabular data.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server on http://localhost:3000

# Production
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start           # Start production server

# Docker
docker-compose up -d    # Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose down     # Stop containers
docker-compose logs -f  # View logs

# Testing
npm test            # Run all tests with Jest
npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
jest __tests__/path/to/specific.test.ts  # Run single test file

# Linting
npm run lint        # Run ESLint with Next.js configuration
```

## Architecture

### Frontend Flow
1. **Main Page** (`app/page.tsx`): Single-page application with certificate designer
2. **Template Upload**: Image files are uploaded via `/api/upload`, converted to PDF, and stored in `public/temp_images/`
3. **Text Positioning**: Drag-and-drop interface allows users to position text fields on the template
4. **Data Input**: Table interface supports TSV/CSV paste with header row toggle
5. **PDF Generation**: `/api/generate` creates individual certificates and merges them into a single PDF

### API Endpoints
- `/api/upload`: Handles image upload and PDF conversion using pdf-lib
- `/api/generate`: Processes certificate generation with positioned text fields
- `/api/files/temp_images/[filename]`: Serves uploaded images in production
- `/api/files/generated/[filename]`: Serves generated PDFs in production

### Key Dependencies
- **pdf-lib**: PDF manipulation and generation
- **formidable**: File upload handling
- **react-table**: Data table implementation
- **shadcn/ui**: UI components (Button, Textarea, Spinner)
- **mime-types**: Content type detection for file serving
- **Docker**: Production containerization

## Testing Approach

Tests are organized by type:
- `__tests__/components/`: UI component tests
- `__tests__/pages/`: Page-level integration tests
- `__tests__/pages/api/`: API endpoint tests
- `__tests__/lib/`: Utility function tests

Run a specific test file:
```bash
npm test -- __tests__/components/Button.test.tsx
```

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Imports**: Use `@/` alias for root imports (`@/components`, `@/lib`, `@/pages`)
- **Components**: React functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes, shadcn/ui components with `cn()` utility
- **State**: React hooks (useState, useMemo, useCallback) with proper TypeScript typing
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks for async operations, console.error for logging
- **Types**: Explicit TypeScript interfaces for props and data structures

## Important Considerations

1. **File Storage**: 
   - Development: Uses `public/` directory
   - Production: Docker volumes mounted to `data/` directory
   - API endpoints handle dynamic file serving in production
2. **No Authentication**: The app is currently open access
3. **Advanced Text Formatting**: 
   - **9 Professional Fonts**: Helvetica, Times, Courier, Montserrat, Poppins, Work Sans, Roboto, Source Sans Pro, Nunito
   - **Kerning-Optimized Selection**: All custom fonts chosen for excellent character spacing and professional typography
   - **Smart Font Capabilities**: Bold/italic buttons automatically disable for fonts that don't support them
   - **Complete Font Controls**: Size (8-72px), family selection, bold, italic, color picker
   - **Live Preview**: All formatting changes appear instantly in the UI
   - Click any text field to access formatting panel with live preview
   - Apply formatting to all fields with one click
4. **Coordinate System**: PDF uses bottom-left origin (0,0), while UI uses top-left origin - conversion happens in the API
5. **Drag System**: Uses pointer events for precise positioning with visual feedback and touch support
6. **Production Mode**: Next.js doesn't serve dynamic files from public/ in production, hence the file serving API

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Production Deployment

### ðŸš§ Planned Features (Priority Order)

**Phase 1 - Infrastructure & Performance**
- **R2 Custom Domain** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
  - Set up custom domain for branded URLs (certificates.yourdomain.com)
  - Configure Cloudflare DNS and SSL
  - Update R2_PUBLIC_URL environment variable
- **R2 Lifecycle Management** (LOW PRIORITY)
  - Implement automatic file cleanup after 7 days
  - Add lifecycle rules for old generated PDFs
  - Optimize storage costs

**Phase 2 - User Experience Features**
- **Format templates** (45 mins)
  - Save/load formatting presets
  - Quick apply saved styles
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (COMPLETED - ESC key, PENDING - Bold/Italic)
  - âœ… ESC key to dismiss all modals
  - Ctrl/Cmd + B for bold
  - Ctrl/Cmd + I for italic

**Phase 3 - Communication Features**
- Email functionality (SMTP, bulk sending, templates)
- Integration with individual PDFs for direct emailing

**Phase 3 - Enhanced Functionality**
- PDF template support (currently only images)
- Template management system (save/load/share)
- Advanced text formatting (text effects, shadows, outlines)

**Phase 4 - Platform Features**
- Authentication & user management (NextAuth.js)
- UI/UX improvements (mobile responsive, undo/redo)
- API development for external integrations

**Phase 5 - Advanced Features**
- QR code generation for verification
- Performance optimization (caching, CDN)
- Webhook notifications

### Technical Considerations for Future Development
- **Email Service**: Consider Nodemailer, Resend, or SendGrid
- **Storage**: Migrate from local filesystem to AWS S3 or similar
- **Database**: Will need PostgreSQL/MongoDB for user management and templates
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on VPS, Vercel, or cloud providers

## Common Development Tasks

When implementing new features:
1. Check the planned features section above for requirements
2. Follow the existing pattern of client-side UI with server-side PDF processing
3. Add appropriate tests for new functionality
4. Ensure TypeScript types are properly defined
5. Consider scalability implications (especially for file storage and email sending)

## Cleanup Plan

### Current Storage Architecture (Pre-R2)

**Development Environment:**
- Files served directly from `public/` directory
- No API size limits, faster serving

**Production Environment:**
- Files served via API routes from Docker volumes
- Maintains compatibility with existing deployments

### Temporary Files to Clean

**Local Development:**
- `public/temp_images/` - Contains uploaded certificate templates
- `public/generated/` - Contains generated PDF certificates

**Docker Production:**
- `./data/temp_images/` - Mounted volume for templates
- `./data/generated/` - Mounted volume for generated PDFs

### Cleanup Commands

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Clean all temporary uploaded images
rm -rf public/temp_images/*

# Clean all generated PDFs  
rm -rf public/generated/*
```

**Docker Production:**
```bash
# Clean mounted volumes
rm -rf ./data/temp_images/*
rm -rf ./data/generated/*

# Full Docker cleanup
docker-compose down
docker system prune -a  # Remove unused images
docker volume prune     # Remove unused volumes
```

### Post-R2 Migration Cleanup Strategy

**With Cloudflare R2:**
- Files stored in cloud with automatic CDN
- Implement R2 lifecycle rules for auto-deletion
- Local files only used as temporary upload staging
- Reduced local storage requirements

**Recommended R2 Lifecycle:**
- Generated PDFs: Delete after 7 days
- Template images: Delete after 30 days (unless saved to templates)
- Individual certificates: Delete after 24 hours

### Cleanup Schedule
- **Development**: Manual cleanup after testing sessions
- **Production (current)**: Implement cron job for files older than 24 hours
- **Production (post-R2)**: Automated via R2 lifecycle rules
- **Docker**: Clean volumes during maintenance windows
