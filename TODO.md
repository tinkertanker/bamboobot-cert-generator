# TODOs 

## 1. Change background image

Use case: What if someone has two of the same cert, and wants to just replace it, keeping all the text positions and properties? If we clear the background image, we might lose all the positioning etc. Also, we should stop referring to background images as templates.

[x] Change the word "template" in "Clear Template" to "Clear background"
[x] Have a feature to replace the background image with a new one, of the same dimensions

## 2. Advanced text sizing

Use case: What if we want to let text auto-resize down to fit into a box? 

[] Change the text positioning box to a bounding box instead of a container? 
[] Allow for multi-line? How? 
[] Allow for shrinking? What happens to the font sizing then?
